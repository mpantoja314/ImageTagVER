#If your file is not too large, you can read it into a string, and just use that (easier and often faster than reading and checking line per line):

#if 'blabla' in open('example.txt').read():
#    print "true"

#Another trick: you can alleviate the possible memory problems by using mmap.mmap() to create a "string-like" object that uses the underlying file (instead of reading the whole file in memory):

#import mmap
#f = open('example.txt')
#s = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ)
#if s.find('blabla') != -1:
#    print 'true'

#NOTE: in python 3, mmaps behave like bytearray objects rather than strings, so the subsequence you look for with find() has to be a bytes object rather than a string as well, eg. s.find(b'blabla'):

#!/usr/bin/env python3
#import mmap

#with open('example.txt', 'rb', 0) as file, \
#     mmap.mmap(file.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ) as s:
#    if s.find(b'blabla') != -1:
#        print('true')

#You could also use regular expressions on mmap e.g., case-insensitive search: if re.search(br'(?i)blabla', s):
